## PluginDefinition

- Kind: `interface`
- Source: [definition.ts](https://github.com/boybook/tx-5dr/blob/main/packages/plugin-api/src/definition.ts)

Describes a TX-5DR plugin module.

The default export of a plugin package or entry file must satisfy this
interface. It combines declarative metadata, optional UI descriptors and the
runtime callbacks that the host invokes after the plugin is loaded.

A plugin can be one of two categories:
- `strategy`: owns the operator automation state machine and is mutually
  exclusive per operator.
- `utility`: augments the pipeline or UI and can run alongside other utility
  plugins.

The TX-5DR host reads this definition once during load, validates the static
fields and then wires the lifecycle callbacks and hooks into the plugin
subsystem.

@example
```js
/** @type {import('@tx5dr/plugin-api').PluginDefinition} *\/
export default {
  name: 'my-plugin',
  version: '1.0.0',
  type: 'utility',
  description: 'Annotates interesting decoded stations.',
  hooks: {
    onDecode(messages, ctx) {
      ctx.log.info('decoded', { count: messages.length });
    },
  },
};
```

@example
```ts
import type { PluginDefinition } from '@tx5dr/plugin-api';

const plugin: PluginDefinition = {
  name: 'my-strategy',
  version: '1.0.0',
  type: 'strategy',
  createStrategyRuntime(ctx) {
    return {
      decide() {
        return { stop: false };
      },
      getTransmitText() {
        return null;
      },
      requestCall() {},
      getSnapshot() {
        return { currentState: 'idle' };
      },
      patchContext() {},
      setState() {},
      setSlotContent() {},
      reset() {},
    };
  },
};

export default plugin;
```

## 成员

### name

Stable machine-readable plugin identifier.

This value is used as the plugin's identity in manifests, persisted
configuration, log records and runtime lookups. Treat it as an immutable ID
once the plugin is released.

```ts

name: string;

```

### version

Semantic version of the plugin implementation.

The host does not currently enforce a compatibility policy, but publishing a
valid semver string makes diagnostics and upgrades much easier.

```ts

version: string;

```

### type

Declares how the host should schedule and combine this plugin.

- `strategy` plugins provide a {@link StrategyRuntime} and are selected as
  the active automation implementation for an operator.
- `utility` plugins participate in filters, scoring, monitoring and UI, but
  do not own the core automation state machine.

```ts

type: PluginType;

```

### description

Human-readable summary shown in plugin management UIs.

Keep this short and product-oriented so operators can quickly understand the
plugin's purpose.

```ts

description?: string;

```

### permissions

Explicitly declares privileged capabilities required by the plugin.

Permissions allow the host to gate sensitive features such as network
access. Always declare the smallest set that the plugin truly needs.

```ts

permissions?: PluginPermission[];

```

### settings

Declarative settings schema for generated configuration forms.

Each key becomes a persisted config entry. The host validates and stores the
values, then exposes the resolved runtime config through
{@link PluginContext.config}. Use this for durable, user-facing settings
rather than ephemeral runtime state.

```ts

settings?: Record<string, PluginSettingDescriptor>;

```

### quickActions

Lightweight button actions shown in operator-facing quick action areas.

These are intended for one-shot commands such as reset, clear or manual
trigger operations. When clicked, the host invokes
{@link PluginHooks.onUserAction} with the configured action id.

```ts

quickActions?: PluginQuickAction[];

```

### quickSettings

Quick settings surfaced in compact operator-facing automation panels.

Use these for high-frequency adjustments that operators may need to tweak
during operation, such as a threshold, target list or enable flag.

```ts

quickSettings?: PluginQuickSetting[];

```

### panels

Panel descriptors used to render plugin-owned UI sections.

Panels are declarative containers. Plugins push live data into them through
{@link PluginContext.ui} rather than rendering custom frontend code.

```ts

panels?: PluginPanelDescriptor[];

```

### storage

Declares which persistent storage scopes should be provisioned.

Request `global` storage for data shared by the whole station, and
`operator` storage for per-operator state. The corresponding stores are then
available via {@link PluginContext.store}.

```ts

storage?: { scopes: ('global' | 'operator')[] };

```

### createStrategyRuntime

Creates the strategy runtime for a `strategy` plugin.

This method is required when {@link PluginDefinition.type} is `strategy` and
should be omitted for utility plugins. The returned runtime becomes the
operator's active automation controller.

```ts

createStrategyRuntime?(ctx: PluginContext): StrategyRuntime;

```

### onLoad

Runs after the plugin instance has been loaded and the context is ready.

Use this for startup work such as warming caches, scheduling timers or
sending initial panel data. Keep it fast; long-running work should be
deferred or done asynchronously.

```ts

onLoad?(ctx: PluginContext): void | Promise<void>;

```

### onUnload

Runs before the plugin instance is unloaded.

Use this to release external resources or flush state that is not already
handled through the host abstractions. Any timers created via
{@link PluginContext.timers} are cleared automatically by the host.

```ts

onUnload?(ctx: PluginContext): void | Promise<void>;

```

### hooks

Event and pipeline hooks implemented by the plugin.

Hooks let utility plugins observe or transform the message flow, and let the
active strategy participate in decision making.

```ts

hooks?: PluginHooks;

```
